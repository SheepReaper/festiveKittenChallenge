# festiveKittenChallenge
This is by far one of the most frustrating projects I have ever worked on. My congratulations to the evil genius behind it. If I ever meet you, I will buy you a beer.

This project is a part challenge, part demonstration of my stubbornness and my ability to program. (maybe some Linux knowledge in there too.)

This is not a production-ready anything. It is the skeleton of what could be a nice app, but I ran out of the time needed to really make it fully functional, stable, and something people would be proud to have.

This product is CONFIDENTIAL, if you are neither myself, or one of the individuals evaluating me, then avert your eyes, this is not for you. 

Feel free to criticize it, but just know, this is my soul in code. So all of the glaring holes you find, will hurt me like you wouldn't believe.

## Installation
I used VS 2019 Community Edition as my IDE. I feel if you already don't have a copy, [then go get one]()
